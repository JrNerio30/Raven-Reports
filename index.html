        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Raven Reports was founded in 1888 by the journalist Edgar Talon, who believed that the raven was a symbol of wisdom. 
          Armed with a quill pen, and an uncanny knack for sniffing out the truth, Sir Talon began publishing hand-pressed newsletters.
          Initially distributed by carrier ravens who were professionally trained to deliver scrolls of news to Calgary's elite, the newsletter quickly gained popularity. The digital age brought Raven Reports to new heights. 
          Today, Raven Reports remains a beacon of journalistic excellence, delivering breaking news all around the world.
